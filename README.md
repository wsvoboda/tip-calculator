This site takes your bill amount, the percentage you would like to tip, and provides your total.

It also has a section that keeps track of the tips you left previously.

If the user accidentally enters an invalid input (the enter letters, too many decimal points, spaces, etc), the site will alert them to enter valid numbers only.
